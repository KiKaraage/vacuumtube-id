# VacuumTube

VacuumTube is an unofficial wrapper of YouTube Leanback (the console and Smart TV version of YouTube) for the desktop, with a built-in adblocker and minor enhancements.

It is **not** a custom client, YouTube Leanback is an official interface. This project simply encompasses it and makes it usable as a standalone desktop application.
